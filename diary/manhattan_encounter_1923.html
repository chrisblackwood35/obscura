    <br>💀 WELCOME TO THE MURMUR ROOM 💀
  </div>
  <div class="container">
    <h1>October 28, 1923 — Late Night, Manhattan</h1>
    <p>I couldn’t go straight to the hotel. Something in me demanded movement. Whiskey, maybe. Human voices. Or just the scent of smoke in the night air to remind me I still existed.</p>
    <p>I walked the streets of Manhattan until I found a bar that looked out of place — or out of time.</p>
    <p><strong>The Murmur Room.</strong></p>
    <p>The red neon sign flickered with irregular insistence, casting feverish reflections on the wet sidewalk. It was the first time I saw one of these in person. In 1923, they were still novelty tech — or the sort of thing used by places that knew more than they showed.</p>
    <p>The light pulsed as if daring the city to stare back.</p>
    <p>I entered.</p>
    <p>Inside, muffled music. Scratched jazz. People too quiet for a Saturday. A man with faded eyes read a trembling newspaper. Two women played cards without exchanging a word. The scent was smoke, old varnish, and restrained despair.</p>
    <p>I sat at the bar. Ordered bourbon. Double.</p>
    <p>Then she arrived.</p>
    <p>Wine velvet. Black gloves up to the elbow. Dark hair, stage presence. She walked like she knew how all stories ended — and still wanted one more.</p>
    <p>She sat beside me uninvited. Ordered gin. Sipped slowly. Didn’t look at me at first — just at my hand, at the scar between my fingers.</p>
    <div class="quote">“You’ve held more than just weapons,” she said.<br>
    “And you have a voice that never needs to ask twice,” I replied.</div>
    <p>She smiled. And I knew it was too late to retreat.</p>
    <p>We spoke little.<br>
    Going back to the hotel with her felt natural. Like falling. Like sealing a pact.</p>
    <p>She didn’t want my name. I didn’t want hers. Just warm skin in the cold night, whispers, tangled sheets.</p>
    <p>She was on top of me — riding with ritual intensity. Each movement deliberate, following a rhythm only she could hear.</p>
    <p>Her eyes locked on mine. That smile...<br>
    Cruel. Delicious. Predatory.</p>
    <p>I should’ve pulled away. But I didn’t.</p>
    <p>It was a flicker.<br>
    Her face changed.</p>
    <p>Not like an illusion. More like the truth bleeding through the skin:<br>
    Flesh too pale. Eyes too hollow.<br>
    Lips darkened. Teeth... wrong. Elongated. Incomplete.<br>
    Something watching from beneath the mask.</p>
    <p>A living apparition on top of me.</p>
    <p>I froze. Heart racing. A scream stuck in my throat.</p>
    <p>But then…<br>
    It didn’t matter.</p>
    <p>The fear was real — for a second. Then it faded like smoke.<br>
    Because whatever she was…<br>
    Demon.<br>
    Predator.<br>
    Shadow in human flesh.</p>
    <p>She wanted me.<br>
    And that was enough.</p>
    <p>I gripped her hips. Pulled her closer. I wanted more. I wanted it all.</p>
    <p>The creature smiled again — the woman returned — and bent down until her lips brushed mine.</p>
    <div class="quote">“Now you understand,” she murmured.<br>“I do,” I answered, not knowing what I meant.</div>
    <p>And I let her take me down.<br>
    For a few hours, everything was far away. Even the forest. Even the mark on the window.<br>
    And that night, I was ready for both.</p>
