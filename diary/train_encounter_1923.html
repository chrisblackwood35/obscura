    <h1>Journal Entry</h1>
    <h2>October 27th, 1923 — Night train, still somewhere in Ohio</h2>

    <p>It’s been over twenty minutes since the train stopped. No explanations. The cold, once confined to the windowpane, now seems to seep up from the rails themselves. Fog clings to the glass, and yet—I can feel eyes watching from beyond it.</p>

    <p>The dragging sound from earlier has vanished. That low, scraping noise... like nails against damp wood. Silence now. Heavy. Like the world is holding its breath for something it fears to name.</p>

    <p>I couldn’t stay seated any longer.</p>

    <p>I threw on my coat, Mauser under the shoulder, and stepped into the hallway—empty. No conductor. No crew. Just muffled voices, careful steps. Everyone afraid to make too much noise.</p>

    <p>I walked toward the rear car. Each step felt like it might shatter the floor beneath me. The outer door gave way with a sharp creak. Beyond it, the forest loomed. Still. Oppressive. The lantern by the door flickered weakly against the void.</p>

    <p>And then—I saw him.</p>

    <p>A man—or something like one—stood between the rails. Tall. Wide-brimmed hat casting shadow over his face. A long coat rippled faintly, but he didn’t move. Just two faint glimmers where his eyes should be.</p>

    <p>I raised the pistol. He didn’t react.</p>

    <div class="quote">“You’ve gone too far, Mr. Blackwood. Turn back while you still can.”</div>

    <p>The voice was smoke and gravel—measured, but wrong. It didn’t echo like it should have. It sounded... placed. As if it had been whispered inside my mind from below the earth.</p>

    <p>I kept my finger on the trigger. Sweat was already trailing down my back.</p>

    <div class="quote">“They made the train stop,” he continued. “They know who you are. And what you carry. They can stop other things, too. Your steps. Your heart. Your mind.”</div>

    <p>I wanted to speak, but the words were gone. Drained by his presence.</p>

    <div class="quote">“Don’t waste the bullet,” he said, tilting his head slightly. “That weapon belongs to your world. I do not.”</div>

    <p>I didn’t shoot. Some part of me knew he was telling the truth. Or worse—that he wanted me to.</p>

    <p>In the blink of an eye, he turned—and vanished into the treeline like a shadow slipping out of view.</p>

    <p>Then the screech of brakes releasing. The train lurched. We were moving again.</p>

    <p>I returned to my compartment, pulse pounding like drums in the dark. I looked out the window…</p>

    <p><strong>He was there.</strong></p>

    <p>Standing. Watching. Unmoving as we rolled past. As if the world bent around him, not the other way around.</p>

    <p><strong>He didn’t chase the train.</strong></p>

    <p><strong>He simply watched me go.</strong></p>

    <p><strong>For now.</strong></p>
