    <h1>Diary Entry – October 14, 1923</h1>
    <h2>Location: Chicago, Illinois</h2>
    <p>It rained all day. That kind of fine, persistent rain that washes the world outside but nothing inside me. I haven’t slept well in three nights — the whispers have returned. Always at the same time: 3:17 AM. As if something is calling me from the other side of the darkness.</p>
    <p>Today I received a letter from France. An old trenchmate, Langley, has gone missing. He was investigating an abandoned village near Reims — apparently tied to an ancient cult, something linked to the symbols we saw in the Cantigny woods. No one else wanted to get involved, so they sent the letter to me. Naturally.</p>
    <p>I still carry the Colt, clean as the day I left the war. Not out of fear of men. But because what I saw that night in 1918... still lives in the cracks of the world. And I have the strange feeling it’s drawing near again.</p>
    <p>Laura came to me in a dream. Her eyes always return in these moments. She held a medallion and said something in German. I woke with a dry throat and my hand over my chest, as if something had tried to pierce my flesh.</p>
    <p>I’ll head to Reims at the end of the month. I need to understand what Langley uncovered.</p>
    <p>The world is quieter than it should be. And that unsettles me.</p>
