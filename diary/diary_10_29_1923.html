    <p>Something arrived tonight. It didn’t come by mail.</p>

    <p>It was leaning against the door of my office when I returned from dinner — a crumpled brown envelope, no postmark, no seal, no name. Not a single word written. Just a faint scent of smoke and a dampness, as if it had passed through a place not bound by time.</p>

    <p>Inside were four photographs. Old, grainy, blurred. But recent enough to unsettle me.</p>

    <p>The first shows a stone corridor, dimly lit by a single lantern. The walls are covered in moss… and markings. The same markings. Three vertical lines inside a rough circle.</p>

    <p>The second… is an empty room. But something is wrong with the light. It looks… warped. As if gravity itself had stopped working properly.</p>

    <p>The third is the hardest to look at. A hooded figure standing among dead trees. The face is a smear of shadow, and where eyes should be, there’s only a dull reflection — like the gleam of a buried mirror.</p>

    <p>The last photo shows a hand. Bloodied. Holding a medallion I instantly recognize: it belongs to Langley.</p>

    <p>No explanation. No signature. But on the back of the fourth photograph, written in small, trembling letters:</p>

    <span class="highlight">“He crossed over. Now, you.”</span>

    <p>I think I won’t sleep tonight. And I believe that was the point.</p>

    <p>But what haunts me more is the question I keep circling: <span class="highlight">Who sent this?</span></p>

    <p>Someone wants to rattle me. That much is clear. Someone who knows about Langley. Someone who has access to these… places. Images.</p>

    <p>And tonight, the silence is screaming.</p>
