      <h1>Journal Entry</h1>
      <div class="meta">October 27th, 1923 — Night train, somewhere in Ohio</div>

      <p>The night was deep when the train came to a halt.</p>

      <p>A soft jolt, but unexpected. The metallic screech of the brakes sliced through the dark like a muffled scream. The train slowed until it stopped completely. No station in sight. Just blackness and dense, unmoving trees — as if the woods were holding their breath.</p>

      <p>For a moment, no one moved.</p>

      <p>Then came the murmurs. A couple in the back whispered in French. A man in a hat leaned toward the window and cursed. The woman in the next cabin knocked, calling for the conductor. Voices rose here and there, still hushed, as if everyone expected a quick explanation.</p>

      <p>The conductor appeared in the corridor minutes later — a thin man with a narrow mustache and eyes too tense for someone meant to be in control. He said the stop was due to "technical reasons," nothing to worry about, and that we should remain seated until further notice.</p>

      <p>But something in his tone was wrong. He avoided eye contact. And he didn’t explain what exactly had happened.</p>

      <p>The car is strangely cold now. The lights flicker like the power is struggling. And there’s a sound — soft, rhythmic — that wasn’t there before. Like something scraping from the forest. Or beneath the rails.</p>

      <p>I reached for the Mauser.</p>

      <p>Some passengers are trying to sleep again. Others are just pretending. I can’t. The conductor returned to the front of the train... but I didn’t hear the engine door open.</p>

      <p>Something is wrong.</p>

      <p>If I hear that sound again, I’ll step out to investigate. The journal will stay here, open. Someone should know what happened, in case I don’t return.</p>
