  <p><strong><a class="post-link" href="https://chrisblackwood35.github.io/obscura/diary/manhattan_encounter_1923" style="color: inherit; text-decoration: none;">The Murmur Room – October 28, 1923</a></strong><br>
  In Manhattan, I found myself drawn to a bar out of place — its red neon bleeding into the night. There, she appeared: velvet and shadow, voice like ritual. What began as seduction revealed something far darker beneath her skin… and yet, I did not turn away.</p>

  <p><strong><a class="post-link" href="https://chrisblackwood35.github.io/obscura/diary/train_encounter_1923" style="color: inherit; text-decoration: none;">The Man by the Rails – October 27, 1923</a></strong><br>
  In the halted silence, I stepped out to find him: a tall figure in hat and coat, eyes glimmering faintly in the dark. His voice cut into my mind, warning me I had gone too far. He vanished into the treeline, yet when the train moved again, he was still there—watching.</p>

  <p><strong><a class="post-link" href="https://chrisblackwood35.github.io/obscura/diary/diary_10_27_1923" style="color: inherit; text-decoration: none;">The Halted Train – October 27, 1923</a></strong><br>
  The train stopped in the dead of night, surrounded by breathless woods. The conductor’s words rang hollow, the lights faltered, and a scraping sound echoed from the forest — or beneath the rails. I keep the Mauser ready. If I step outside, and do not return, this journal will tell the rest.</p>

  <p><strong><a class="post-link" href="https://chrisblackwood35.github.io/obscura/diary/diary_10_21_1923" style="color: inherit; text-decoration: none;">The Photographs – October 21, 1923</a></strong><br>
  A crumpled envelope awaited me at my door. Inside: four disturbing photographs — a marked corridor, a warped room, a hooded figure, and Langley’s bloodied medallion. On the back, a chilling message: ‘He crossed over. Now, you.’ Sleep will not come tonight.</p>

  <p><strong><a class="post-link" href="https://chrisblackwood35.github.io/obscura/diary/diary_10_14_1923" style="color: inherit; text-decoration: none;">Whispers in the Rain – October 14, 1923</a></strong><br>
  After three nights haunted by whispers at 3:17 AM, I received a letter from France: Langley has vanished near Reims, chasing symbols we once saw in Cantigny. The Colt is still at my side, for what lives in the cracks of the world may be stirring again.</p>
